DOMAIN: FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH


As part of my 6-week frontend web development internship at Codetech, I created a responsive Personal Portfolio Website using only HTML and CSS. This project was aimed at helping us practice building clean, professional webpages without relying on JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

The portfolio features a structured, single-page layout with sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact. Itâ€™s designed to be fully responsive, working smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. I focused on creating a minimal but modern aesthetic using clean fonts, a simple color palette, and clear visual hierarchy.

The "Projects" section highlights two of my real-world projects: an Emotional Chatbot and Task Buddy, a productivity assistant for students. The layout is semantic and accessible, using proper tags and styling to ensure clarity and consistency.

This project helped reinforce my HTML/CSS fundamentals, including responsive layouts, flexbox, and media queries. It also taught me the importance of organizing content and keeping code maintainable. All development was done using Visual Studio Code, and version control was managed with Git and GitHub.

Overall, this portfolio acts as a foundation for showcasing my skills and will grow as I build and add more projects over time.
